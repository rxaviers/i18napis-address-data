# i18napis Address Data

***Unofficial*** version controlled JSON distribution [i18napis Address Data](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata), hosted at https://chromium-i18n.appspot.com/ssl-address.

It should be noted that the "official" data is distributed via a web service. The JSON data contained in this package is provided as a convenience for the development community, and is programatically generated from the corresponding service using the JSON conversion utility provided here.

## Goals

- The data in this package is intended to serve as a common reference point for most JavaScript packages.
- Allow i18n libraries to define i18napis Address Data as versioned dependency.

### What's not included

No code other than the conversion utility is included.
